# Customer Shopping Trends Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains the code and analysis for a project aimed at uncovering insights from a customer shopping trends dataset. The dataset captures a wide range of customer attributes, including age, gender, purchase history, preferred payment methods, and more. By analyzing this data, we gain valuable insights that can help businesses make informed decisions, optimize product offerings, and enhance customer satisfaction.
